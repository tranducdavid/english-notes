## Is specific?
>If you need to single out a countable noun in the singular and to make it specific and the only one, use the definite article "the". Usually, some additional information is needed in the sentence to single out this noun, for example, the of-phrase or a subordinate clause.

Examples:
>Rome is the capital of Italy.
>Who is the author of this story?
>The result of his actions was awful.
>The tomato in this bowl is yellow.
>The elephant on the right is from Africa.
>The story that I'm reading is very sad.
>He is the teacher that I told you about.
>Here is the article that we discussed yesterday.
>The car that I like is expensive.
>I bought the table that cost fifty dollars.
>I need the book written by Professor Baker last year.
