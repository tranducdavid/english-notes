```

- If I received multiple pens, would that mean I wouldn't use `the` article because there are multiple pens that I received?

>I bought the table that cost fifty dollars.
- There are multiple tables in existence that cost 50 dollars, so why is there `the`?

>The elephant on the right is from Africa.
>Here is the article that we discussed yesterday.
- Same as the pen question.

>This is the book that you wanted.
- Why is there `the`? Does that mean that there are no copies of that book?
